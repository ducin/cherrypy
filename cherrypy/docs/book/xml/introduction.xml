  <para>CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework. It provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications can be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying protocols. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy does its best to stay out of the way between the programmer and the problem. CherryPy applications are usually very simple. It works out of the box; default behavior is sensible enough to allow use without extensive setup or customization. The embedded web server allows one to deploy web applications anywhere Python is installed. In short, CherryPy is as pythonic as it gets.
