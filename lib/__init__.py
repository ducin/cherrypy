class ExposeItems:
    """
    Utility class that exposes a getitem-aware object. It does not provide
    index() or default() methods, and it does not expose the individual item
    objects - just the list or dict that contains them. User-specific index()
    and default() methods can be implemented by inheriting from this class.
    
    Use case:
    
    from cherrypy.lib import ExposeItems
    ...
    cpg.root.foo = ExposeItems(mylist)
    cpg.root.bar = ExposeItems(mydict)
