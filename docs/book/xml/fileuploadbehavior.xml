    <title>File upload</title>
    <para>Before version 2.1, CherryPy was handling file uploads as follows: it was reading the entire file in memory, store it in a string and pass it to the method. 
        This works well for small files but not so well for big files.</para>
        
        <para>CherryPy 2.1 uses the python <code>cgi</code> module to parse the POST data. 
            When a file is being uploaded, this modules stores it in a temp file and returns a <code>FieldStorage</code> instance which contains information about this file. 
            CherryPy then passes this <code>FieldStorage</code> instance to the method, this instance has the following attributes:</para>
        
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><code>file</code>: the file(-like) object from which you can read the data</listitem>
        <listitem><code>filename</code>: the client-side filename</listitem>
        <listitem><code>type</code>: the content-type of the file </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
