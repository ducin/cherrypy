    <abstract>CherryPy tries to bring to Python developers a system that let them use their language
        to develop web application as they would use it for any other type of environment. Therefore,
        building a web application with CherryPy is very straightforward and does not require the
        developer to change his/her habits, nor to learn many features before being able to pull out a
        working application. This section will review the basic bricks offered by CherryPy to build an 
        application.</abstract>
