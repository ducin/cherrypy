  <title>Static content handling</title>
  <para>Static content is now handled by a filter called "static_filter" that
  can easily be enabled and configured in your config file. For instance, if
  you wanted to serve <code>/style.css</code> from
  <filename>/home/site/style.css</filename> and <code>/static/*</code> from
  <filename>/home/site/static/*</filename>, you can use the following
  configuration:</para>
  <example>
    <title>Static filter configuration</title>
    <programlisting>
            [global]
            static_filter.root = "/home/site"
            
            [/style.css]
            static_filter.on = True
            static_filter.file = "style.css"
            
            [/static]
            static_filter.on = True
            static_filter.dir = "static"
        </programlisting>
  </example>
  <para>The <code>static_filter.root</code> entry can be either absolute or
  relative. If absolute, static content is sought within that absolute path.
  Since CherryPy cannot guess where your application root is located, relative
  paths are assumed to be relative to the directory where your
  <code>cherrypy.root</code> class is defined (if you do not provide a root,
  it defaults to "", and therefore to the directory of your
  <code>cherrypy.root</code> class).</para>
  <para>As an application developer, the design of your application affects
  whether you choose to use absolute or relative paths. If you are creating a
  one-off application that will only be deployed once, you might as well use
  absolute paths. But you can make multiple deployments easier by using
  relative paths, letting CherryPy calculate the absolute path each time for
  you. Absolute paths, however, give deployers the ability to place static
  content on read-only filesystems, or on faster disks.</para>
